Tutorial: It should be easy, I am not explaining to skids who can't even understand Python.

# Feautres
	🟢Grabs Cookie from (Edge, Opera (GX), Chrome, etc.)
	🟢Sends Robux, Premium Status, Username, IP Address, RAP, Creation Date & Age
	🟢Sends multiple cookie-results if multiple are found between different browsers.
	🟢Is not dualhooked unlike the previous shit
